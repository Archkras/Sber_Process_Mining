# SberProcessMining (SberPM) - Process Mining python framework


SberPM is the open python framework for conducting analysis of business processes with the use of process mining and machine learning techniques. 

With SberPM you can:
- Visualize the process as a graph. 
*(Simple Miner, Causal Miner, Heuristic Miner, Alpha/Alpha+ Miners)*
- Calculate various metrics of the process. 
*(A number of metrics are calculated for different groups of objects: IDs, unique traces (=sequences of activities), activities, transitions (=two consequent activities), users).*
- Vectorize the process. *(Count Vectorizer)*
- Automatically find the insights of the process. 
*(After the process is represented as a graph, nodes and edges whose particular metrics have high values are highlighted).*

SberPM python library is being developed by Sber Process Mining Team.
